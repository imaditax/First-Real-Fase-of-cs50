Some progress on the journey
As in the week 1 of the program , we did the C language with its fundamentals of the coding , it was a really good part and i enjoyed working on this , we did a simple introduction , as well as printing specefic triangles as mario and a coins calculating code , it was a very good boost in thw writing of the language and made it automatic writing code with a bit of the fixing mindset
